\section{Scoring} \label{sec:ScoringAndRanking}

For each test the calculation of scores is defined individually, comprising points for achieving certain subtasks,
points for winning a run and penalty points.
\par
Each test provides a set of so-called feature variations encoding the overall variability of the test (e.g. whether
obstacles can occur or not, number and type of manipulation objects). To enhance comparability among different test
runs, all teams will have to perform the same test instances as specified in Table~\ref{tab:Instances}.
\par
If not specified otherwise, the following set of scoring rules applies for each test:


Explanation of the terms:
\begin{itemize}
\item Correct navigating is defined in Section \ref{ssec:Navigating}
\item Correct grasping is defined in Section \ref{ssec:GraspingObjects}
\item Correct placing is defined in Section \ref{ssec:PlacingObjects}
\end{itemize}

\section{Simplifications}
Teams may use simplifications, which will result in a reduction of scores for the given run. The simplifications may be
chosen per run, but need to be announced to the referees at least one hour before the start of the run.

\begin{itemize}
	\item Use of external sensors: \hfill -200 points
	\item Use of other external objects (e.g. to support localization): \hfill -100 points
	\item Use of own loading or unloading areas: \hfill -200 points
  \item Deactivation of Barrier Tape: -15\% of total points of the run
\end{itemize}

Additional simplifications are specified for individual tests. These reductions do not count as penalty points. Teams
that want to make use of the simplifications above have to announce them in advance of the competition to the TC. The
TC might forbid the use of specific elements for simplification if these are not in the spirit of the league or may
cause disproportionate advantages for a team.

\section{Penalties}
\label{sec:penalties}
Penalty points are given as follows, each time again the incident occurs:

\begin{itemize}
	\item A manipulation object is dropped to the floor outside of a manipulation area: \hfill -100 points
	\item Delivering a wrong manipulation object to service area \hfill -50 points
	\item Minor collision (see Section \ref{sec:Collisions}): \hfill -50 points
	\item Major collision (see Section \ref{sec:Collisions}): \hfill -50 points and termination of the run
  \item Barrier Tape collision (see Section \ref{sec:Collisions}): \hfill -5\% of total points of current run up till
  20\%
\end{itemize}

\section{Collisions}\label{sec:Collisions}

For reasons of safety of people and property it is strictly unwanted for the robot to collide with any of the
environmental objects. Only collisions of the manipulator with the upside of the service area are allowed. The
different kind of collisions that can occur are defined in the following subsections.

\subsection{Minor Collision}

If the robot collides with an interaction element of the arena (RTT, PPT Cavities, upper level of Shelf) it is
considered a minor collision. The only exception is the collision of the manipulator of the robot with the surface of
the manipulation area.

\subsection{Major Collision}

If the robot collides with a static element of the environment it is considered a major collision.

\subsection{Tape collisions}

\begin{description}
  \item[Yellow/Black Tape]: This tape is called Barrier Tape and represents a virtual fence. If any part of the robot
  touches a barrier tape, it is considered a Barrier Tape Collision. Barrier Tape collision induce a point penalty
  proportional to the final points of the run. With each collision 5\% of the final points are deducted up to a maximum
  of 20\%. For beginner teams the option exists to opt-out of Barrier Tape and take a static deduction of 15\% of the
  final points of the run.
  \item[Red/White Tape]: This tape represents a virtual wall. This wall shall not be crossed. A robot touching this
  tape is considered a major collision. This tape is typically used to limit the area of the arena.
  \item[Blue/White Tape]: This tape is used to indicate 0cm workstations and gates. Robot Collisions with this tape
  only induces a penalty if a gate is crossed twice. In this case a Major Collision occurred.
\end{description}

\section{Restarts}
Teams might use one so-called restart in a run. Restarts have the following aspects:

\begin{itemize}

	\item Per run, at most one restart is allowed for a team, if not specified otherwise in a test.
	\item At any time during a run, the team can call for a restart to the referees.
	\item When the referees acknowledge the call for restart, the team may enter the arena. The time will continue running.
	\item The arena and the robot will be reset exactly to the setup at the beginning of the run (except the timer for the run). Random elements such as obstacles or object positions remain like before.
	\item The points for this run achieved so far are reset to zero.
	\item Scores that are received after a restart are multiplied by a factor of 0.75.
	\item The referees decide when the arena is prepared again for the restart. If the robot is not yet ready, teams can keep trying to get it ready until the time for the run is over.
	\item As soon as the team signals that the robot is ready, the task specification is sent again.
	\item Afterwards the start signal is sent from the referee box.

\end{itemize}


\section{Ranking}
The tests will occur in the instances shown in Table~\ref{tab:Instances}. Ranking of the teams will be based on the sum of the achieved points over all the tests.

A team cannot get less than zero points for one run.
The scores of the tests of the first stage are summed up, and the teams with the highest sums proceed to the next stage.

In case of a tie, the OC will either schedule a deciding run or continue with a higher number of participants.
