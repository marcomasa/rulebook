Each of the particular tests defined later in this document may define its own scenario. In this document, a scenario consists of elements such as the

\begin{itemize}
	\item environment,
	\item objects that affect navigation,
	\item objects that are to be manipulated,
	\item objects with which robots interact,
	\item number of robots allowed per team,
	\item number of teams competing simultaneously in the same arena,
	\item task to be performed by a team, and
	\item the criteria for evaluating a team's performance.
\end{itemize}

In order to avoid excessive development efforts for each specific test and to allow reuse of partial functionalities the scenarios are built from a reasonably small set of components, which are later put together in different ways. This section describes these elements.

\section{Design of Robots}
The robots used for competition shall satisfy professional quality standards. The concrete definition of these standards is to be assessed by the TC, comprising aspects such as sturdy construction, general safety, and robust operation. It is not required that the robots are certified for industrial use.

\subsection{Design and Constraints} \label{ssec:RobotDesignAndConstraints}
%The robots need to comply with certain size constraints. A robot, including all parts attached to it as used in the competition, must be able to move by itself into a configuration so that it fits into a box of side lengths 80 cm x 55 cm x 110 cm (length x width x height). If all the robot's parts, such as manipulator or anything able to protrude outside of the previously specified box, are fully extended, the system must still not exceed a box of side lengths 120 cm x 80 cm x 160 cm (length x width x height). The organizers may specify further constraints, such as weight limits. If a team would like to apply a robot with deviating robot dimensions, it should contact the TC. Exceptions for specific robots are possible in case of small differences.

There are no constraints regarding the size and weight of the used robots, but that they have to fit in the arena defined in section \ref{sec:ArenaDesign}. The minimum passage width is 80cm. The used robots must be able to maneuver in that space.\par

The used batteries may not exceed 500Wh of capacity for safety. 300Wh of capacity is recommended. See subsection \ref{sec:RobotBehaviorAndSafety} as well.\par 

The maximum speed of the robots may not exceed 1.5 m/s. The robot should also be able to halt in a reasonable space on concrete floor.\par 
\par
All robots must have an emergency stop button. The emergency stop has to be a hard stop mechanism, that ensures that the energy transfer to all actuators is stopped immediately and the robot halts. The mechanism must be a red emergency stop button that is clearly visible, easily accessible and per wire attached to the robot. A wireless emergency stop button is optional but not sufficient.
The OC may request the proof of a robot's safety (e.g. the correct operation of an emergency stop) anytime during the competition and exclude teams that cannot satisfy safety requirements.
\par
Electric, pneumatic, and hydraulic actuation mechanisms are permitted, provided that they are constructed and produced according to professional standards and meet safety constraints. Combustion engines and any kind of explosives are strictly forbidden. Robots may not pollute or harm their environment in any way, e.g. by loss of chemicals or oil, spilling liquids, or exhausting gases. Furthermore, constraints on the noise generated by a robot in operation may apply. These will be communicated in due time.
\par
Further, the following assumptions are made about the kind of robots used in the competition:
\par
\begin{itemize}

	\item At least one of the robots used by a team is mobile and moves on wheels. No specific assumptions are made about the kinematic design, but the mobile robots should be able to move on basically flat, sufficiently firm surfaces.
	\item The robots have at least one manipulator and are able to grasp objects, which are graspable by a parallel gripper with a jaw width of at least 5 cm and do not weigh more than 300 g.
	\item The manipulator of the robot should be designed and mounted on the robot such that it can grasp objects from heights between 0 cm and 40 cm above the floor.
	\item The robots use sensors to obtain information about their whereabouts in the environment and the task-relevant objects. The major types of sensors that may be used by the robots include:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Laser range finders (cf. models by Hokuyo or Sick)
		\item Color CCD cameras (cf. any kind of USB camera)
		\item 3D cameras (cf. any kind of camera with depth information)
	\end{itemize}
	\item The design of the scenario should be such that the robots can solve the tasks safely and robustly using (all or a subset of) these sensors.

\end{itemize}

\par
If there are even vague doubts about the eligibility of using particular designs, parts, or mechanisms, the team should consult the TC well in advance.
\par
The robots have to be marked such that a clear distinction of robots used by different teams during a test is possible for spectators. The OC can define the concrete types of markers to be used. In this case the markers are not taken into account when checking the robot's size constraints. The markers shall not interfere with safe operation of the robot.
\par
The TC may require that robots are equipped with a wireless communication device of some sort (e.g. 802.11n), in order to communicate task specifications to the robots.
\par
Future competitions may foresee the use of RFID sensors in the scenario design.


\subsection{Behavior and Safety} \label{ssec:RobotBehaviorAndSafety}
For safety the robots have to meet the constraints in section \ref{ssec:RobotDesignAndConstraints}. In general, all robots shall be operated with maximum safety in mind. Any robot operation must be such that a robot neither harms humans nor damages the environment. \par 
The used batteries shall be handled with care and all team members must be educated in the correct usage, charging and storage of the batteries of the team. For lithium batteries appropriate storage bags must be used by the teams. The OC supplies a fire extinguisher for lithium batteries at the competition. If this is not sufficient for the used batteries of a team. The team is responsible for supplying an appropriate fire extinguisher by themselfs. The OC and TC control the observance of this rules.

When participating in a competition, the team may operate the robot only in their own team area, in the arenas provided (possibly constrained by a schedule assigning periods of time for exclusive use of the arena by a team or a group of teams), and in any other areas designated by the organizers for robot operation. Any operation of robots outside of these areas, e.g. in public areas or emergency paths, require prior permission by the OC.

\section{Referee Box}
The TC shall provide a referee box that supports the evaluation of the competition. It applies the time measuring, generates the tasks according to the chosen test configuration and monitors the
competition. For this purpose each robot has to transmit a keep-alive signal every second during all phases (initialization, preparation, game, finish).

The referee box
\begin{enumerate}
  \item announces the start of the preparation time,
  \item communicates the task specifications,
  \item starts each competition run, and
  \item closes a successful run after reaching the endzone, or
  \item aborts the run in case of a time lapse (indicated by a sound signal of the refbox).
\end{enumerate}

% Figure \ref{fig:refbox} depicts the progress of a competition run.
When the robot is initialized, it starts immediately to transmit its beacon
signal. The referee box answers with a state information. If the previous robot
has left the arena, one of the referees starts the seconded phase by pushing a
button. The referee box transmits a new state message that informs the robot
about the beginning of the initialization phase. Inside the referee box a
timer is started which initiates the start of the execution phase after
transmitting the test parameters. During the run the robot is able to activate
the external devices and to receive their status information. This run phase is
terminated by a second timer that alerts after the duration defined in the
instance table.

a reference implementation.

\section{Design of the Environment}
\label{sec:ArenaDesign}
\subsection{Size of the Arena}

The size of a competition arena is a rectangular area not less than 2 m x 4 m and not more than 10 m x 12 m. The minimum distance between arena elements(service areas and walls) is 80cm if the passage should be passable for the robot.\par 
An orientation is always associated with the arena. An arbitrary wall is designated as “North” orientation, and the wall to its right is designated as “East” and so on. The orientations will be assigned by the local league chair or/and the TC as soon as the arena is built up. Figure~\ref{fig:example_arena} shows one possible example of an arena configuration, while Figure~\ref{fig:example_topological_map} illustrates the topology.

\caption{Topological map with five service areas (D1, D2, S1, S2, S3). The purple squares define places.}
\label{fig:example_topological_map}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Floor}
The floor is made of some firm material. Examples include floors made of concrete, screed, timber, plywood, chipboard, laminated boards, linoleum, PVC flooring, or carpet. Some examples are illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:example_floors}. Floors may neither be made of loose material of any kind (gravel, sand, or any material which may damage the functioning of the robots' wheels) nor may such material be used on top of the floor. Liquids of any kind are not allowed. The floor may have spots of unevenness of up to 1 cm in any direction (clefts, rifts, ridges, etc.).

\end{center}
\caption{Examples of floors that can be used for \RCAW arenas.}
\label{fig:example_floors}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Walls and Virtual Walls}
The competition arena is partially surrounded by walls. Parts of the outer border that are not blocked by walls will be marked by red/white barrier tape and count as virtual walls. The height of the walls is not less than 20 cm and not more than 40 cm. One or more gates may be foreseen, where robots can enter or leave the arena. Gates are indicated by yellow/black tape, which may be crossed once per gate without penalty. Most of the walls are supposed to have a uniform color. Small visual elements like logos or advertisements may be placed on the walls. Virtual Walls are considered Walls regarding Penalization \ref{sec:ScoringAndRanking}.


\subsection{Barrier Tape} \label{ssec:barrier_tape}
The arena may include virtual fences marked by yellow/black on the floor, which are called Barrier Tapes (see Figure \ref{fig:barrier_tape}).

The barrier tapes on the floor of the arena mark dangerous zones and are not to be crossed. The penalty for those collisions can be found under section \ref{sec:penalties}.

The barrier tape is also used to frame the entrance and exit area. The robot is allowed to cross this kind of barrier only at the beginning of a test to enter arena and at the end for leaving.

The blue/white tape is not considered a barrier tape or a virtual wall but marks the service areas of 0 cm height (see Section \ref{ssec:serviceareas}).

\begin{figure} [h!]
\centering
\includegraphics[width= 0.7\textwidth ]{./images/barrier_tapes_in_china15.jpg}
\caption{Example of barrier tape used during \RC 2015. The red/white tape is used to indicate virtual walls , while the yellow/black one denotes a virtual fence.}
\label{fig:barrier_tape}
\end{figure}



\subsection{Entrance and Exit}
If possible, the arena should have one entrance and one exit, which are equipped with laser barriers. These barriers are used for timekeeping by the referee box.


\subsection{Obstacles}
An arena defined for a particular test may foresee the use of obstacles. Obstacles may by passive (i.e. not able to relocate by themselves) or active (e.g. other robots). The size of obstacles should be not lesser than 10 cm x 10 cm x 5 cm; there is no upper bound on the size. The details about the dynamic objects are not known before the competition and will be chosen by the OC or TC on-site. Examples for obstacles are trash bins, boxes, big aluminium profiles or even other robots.


\subsection{Service Areas} \label{ssec:serviceareas}

Arenas contain one or more service areas, which have specific purposes for a particular test.
Examples include loading and unloading areas, rotating tables, storage areas, etc.
Service areas may contain specific environment objects, such as shelves, racks, etc.
They may be accessible from different locations, i.e. it might be possible to reach an area from two or more sides.
Note that service areas can have different heights, which are fixed at the arena setup time and mantained for the entire cometition.
However, from 2020 on and in order to make the competition more realistic, the heights of the service areas will be variable, allowing the OC to adjust them before each test run.
If a service area has a height of zero cm, a tape will mark the area (see Figure \ref{fig:barrier_tape_0cm}).
The tape will be on the floor and will be blue/white striped.
The surounded area may be covered by a white sheet of paper fixed by the tape.
The OC is responsible to replace it in case of pollution or tears.
This tape may be crossed, and does not count as a collision.
If the robot touches a manipulation object while navigating, this will be handled as a collision.

\begin{figure} [h!]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[height = 2.5cm]{./images/barrier_tape_0cm_area.jpg}
\end{center}
\caption{Barrier tape used to mark service areas with 0 cm height.}
\label{fig:barrier_tape_0cm}
\end{figure}

Until 2017, service areas have always been represented by white coloured surfaces with no other decoy objects on it than the official ones in Tables \ref{tab:manipulation_objects} and \ref{tab:manipulation_objects_rockin}.
However, this does not represent real life scenarios.
The robot might have to pick objects from different colored or dirty places. Also there could be other industrial items on the surface area that the robot must avoid.
In order to make the operating environment more realistic, different kinds of arbitrary surfaces (Figure \ref{fig:ast_surface_example}) with decoy industrial items (Figure \ref{fig:ast_example}) have been introduced.
To facilitate the participation of newer teams that are yet focused on more basic functionalities, the integration of arbitrary surfaces is by now limited to:
\begin{itemize}
\item One service area during the BTT1.
\item Two service areas during the BTT2.
\item Two service areas during the BTT3.
\item Three service areas during the final round.
\end{itemize}

\label{fig:ast_example}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Containers}
As in many industrial settings, the \RCAW environment may be equipped with several containers (see Figure~\ref{fig:containers}). They can store any kind of manipulation object defined in Section~\ref{ssec:ManipulationObjects}. Robots are supposed either to grasp one or multiple objects out of containers or to place previously grasped objects into them. Several containers can be present in the environment and are always associated with a service area. That means that the container itself will be placed on top and within the manipulation zone defined in Section~\ref{ssec:ManipulationZone}.
It is also possible that more than one container is placed on top of a single service area.
The constraints defined in Section~\ref{ssec:ManipulationZone} apply also to the containers.

Currently, a container itself does to not need to be manipulated or transported by the robot.

\begin{figure} [h!]

\end{center}
\caption{Containers can be used for grasping objects out or placing objects into them.}
\label{fig:containers}
\end{figure}

%\subsection{Racks}
%Service areas, e.g. loading and unloading areas, may foresee the use of racks. Objects to be delivered or removed from racks have to be placed or picked up from the top. The height of the racks should be not lesser than 5 cm and not more than 40 cm. The color for the top surface of racks is a bright uniform color such as white or light gray, unless a test specifies a different color. The top surface of the rack may be specially designed in order to serve specific purposes, e.g. holding objects.

\subsection{Shelves}\label{sec:Shelves}
Service areas may foresee the use of shelves and shelf units as depicted in Figure~\ref{fig:shelf}. Objects to be delivered or removed from shelves have to be placed or picked sideways. The height of the shelves should be not lesser than 5 cm and not be more than 40 cm.
The shelf surface may be specially designed in order to serve specific purposes, e.g. holding objects.

\caption{Technical draw of shelf configuration.}
\label{fig:shelf}
\end{figure}

\section{Design of Navigation Tasks} \label{sec:NavigationTasks}
Every task has some navigation involved in it. Successful navigation will be awarded in every test according to Table \ref{tab:InstancePoints}. If not defined differently in the respective test, a navigation is successful when the robot reached the service area as defined in section \ref{ssec:Navigating}. 

\textbf{REMARK:} Since 2020 the BNT test is removed from the set of tests done at the competition. Remark that points for reaching service areas are given in all tests, so that teams which are only able to navigate with their robot can still achieve points in all tests.


\subsection{Reaching a Service Area} \label{ssec:Navigating}
A service area counts as successfully reached if the robot would be able to manipulate the service area it is standing on. The manipulation range will be subjectively evaluated by the referees.


\section{Design of Manipulation Tasks} \label{sec:ManipulationTasks}


\subsection{Manipulation Zone} \label{ssec:ManipulationZone}
The manipulation zone defines the area where objects can be placed. Thereby, the following constraints need to be satisfied:
\begin{itemize}
	\item The maximum depth of the manipulation zone is 20 cm.
	\item The minimum distance between objects to each other is 2 cm.
	\item The minimum distance of the beginning of the manipulation zone to a wall is 10 cm.
	\item There as an offset of 2 cm from the border of the service area to the manipulation zone.
\end{itemize}
Note, the constraints do not permit, that objects can be partially occluded dependent on the viewpoint.
\begin{figure} [h!]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth ]{./images/manipulation_zone.pdf}
\caption{Manipulation zone: the green color indicates the area where objects can be placed on a service area by the referees.}
\label{fig:manipulation_zone}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Manipulation Objects} \label{ssec:ManipulationObjects}
The manipulation objects in \RCAW shall include a wide range of objects relevant in industrial applications of robotics. They eventually cover any raw material, (semi-)finished parts or products as well as tools and possibly operating materials required for manufacturing processes.
\par
The intention is to start with a simple set of objects of different shapes and colors. Every year, the spectrum shall then be widen in at least one aspect. The initial set of objects includes basic standard screws and nuts with various sizes and masses as shown in Table~\ref{tab:manipulation_objects} and Table~\ref{tab:manipulation_objects_rockin}. Objects of one kind can slightly vary e.g. considering the surface.

For the placement of manipulation objects the following terms are used:

\begin{itemize}
\item Position: point within 2D coordinate system of a service area,
\item Rotation: rotation around vertical axis of a service area,
\item Orientation: rotation around horizontal axes of a service area, i.e. whether the object is standing upright or lying on its side
\item Pose: combination of position, rotation and orientation.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Grasping Objects} \label{ssec:GraspingObjects}
If not specified differently in a test, the following definition applies to decide if an object counts as being grasped from a service area.
\par
An object counts as grasped from a service area, when the object was moved outside of the source service area. Outside means, that the vertical projection of the object’s convex hull does not touch the service area any more.

\par
The last point shall enable to let the robot pick up an object in order to analyse its type, e.g. by holding it close to a camera on the robot.
\par
If the robot handles an object, but does not fulfill all points above, the object does not count as being grasped, and neither points for grasping a required object, nor penalty points for grasping an unspecified object are given. Still, if the object drops to the ground or an uncontrolled collision occurs, the normal penalty points apply.

\subsection{Placing Objects on Service Areas} \label{ssec:PlacingObjects}
If not specified differently in a test, a manipulation object counts as placed on a target service area if any part of the object is touching the surface of the service area and the object is not moving at the end of the run. An objects does not count as placed when it is dropped (e.g. dropped from a height above 5 cm). This is to avoid that robots throw objects and potentially harm people or property.
\par
The pose of the object on the service area can be chosen freely by the robot.

%\section{Overall Scenario and Variation Points}
%The following two figures illustrate the kind of arenas that can be built with the previously described components. Figure \ref{fig:example_map} shows an old arena configuration (from IROS 2012) as a topological map defining places and connections, while Figure \ref{fig:example_map_go13} shows an arena configuration (from German Open 2013) with only a few surrounding walls, more open space and a conveyor belt.
