\subsection{League Infrastructure}
In order to provide a forum for continuous discussions between teams and other stakeholders, the league builds and maintains an infrastructure consisting of a web site, mailing lists, and repositories for documentation, software, and data. The infrastructure is complemented by a minimum infrastructure to be built and maintained by teams, i.e. teams should eventually create their own web page to which the \RCAW League's web pages can be linked.

\subsubsection{Infrastructure Maintained by the League} \label{ssec:LeagueInfrastructure}

\paragraph{Website}
The official website of \RCAW is at
\begin{center}
\url{https://atwork.robocup.org/}.
\end{center}

This web site is the central place for information about the league. It contains general introductory information plus links to all other infrastructure components, such as a league wiki, the mailing lists, important documents such as this rule book, announcements of upcoming events as well as past events and participating teams.

\paragraph{Mailing Lists}
The league maintains several mailing lists:
\begin{description}
	\item[\texttt{rc-work@lists.robocup.org}] This is the general \RCAW mailing list. Anyone can subscribe, but a real name must be provided either as part of the email address or being specified on the mailing list subscription page. The list is moderated in order to avoid abuse by spammers. New members can subscribe to this list here: \url{http://lists.robocup.org/listinfo.cgi/rc-work-robocup.org}.

	\item[\texttt{rc-work-tc@lists.robocup.org}] This is the mailing list for the TC. Posts from non-members have to be approved by the list moderator. Approvals will be given only in well-justified cases.
\end{description}

\paragraph{Repositories}
Several repositories are publicly available under the official \RCAW Github account:
\begin{center}
\url{https://github.com/robocup-at-work}
\end{center}

The repositories provide 3D models for the manipulation objects, their corresponding PPT cavities, and all arena elements. Additionally, the sources to this rulebook, the implementation of the referee box, and various tools can be found.


\subsubsection{Infrastructure Maintained by Teams}
Each team is requested to build and maintain a minimum infrastructure for its team. This infrastructure consist of

\begin{itemize}
	\item team web site,
	\item team contact, and
	\item team mailing address.
\end{itemize}

The team web site should contain the following information:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Name of the team, and team logo, if any
	\item Affiliation of the team
	\item Team leader including full contact information
	\item List of team members
	\item Description of the team's research interest and background
	\item Description of specific approach pursued by the team
	\item Description of the robot(s) used by the team
	\item List of relevant publications by team members

\end{itemize}

The team contact should be the official contact of the team. Usually, for university-based teams, this would be an academic person such as a professor or post-doc, who should, however, be responsive and be able to answer quickly when contacted by email.
\par
The team mailing address should be an email alias, which should be used to subscribe the team to the general \RCAW mailing list. The email alias should at least include the team contact and the team leader.
