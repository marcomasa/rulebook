\section{Simulation Evaluation Test}

\subsection{Purpose and Focus of the Test}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Capability for scientific evaluation
  \item Especially Scalability 
  \item Integration test
  \item Easy start for new teams
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Scenario Environment}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Simulation environment
  \item free to be used
  \item replicates parts of the real arena, robots, objects, sensors etc.
  \item Execution of one task as specified in Section~\ref{sec:tests}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Task}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Show execution of a single task as specified in Section~\ref{sec:tests}
  \item Use virtual model of (parts of) robot as used in real competition by the team
  \item Indicate precision and simulation speed
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Rules}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Virtual representation based on the object and table definitions from \url{https://github.com/robocup-at-work/models}
  \item Virtual represention of the teams robot
  \item Free to use (for robotic teams) simulation software / environment
  \item Execution of a task as specified in Section~\ref{sec:tests}
  \item Start of task by Referee Box see Setion~\ref{sec:refbox}
  \item Indication of precision in Form of reproduction accuracy (execute multiple times and compare results)
  \item Indication of simulation speed based on realtime factor (Quatient between virtual clock speed and real world time)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Scoring}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Referees grade task execution in simulation based on the following criteria:
  \item Up to 100 Points for Ease of Use
  \item Up to 100 Points for Visualization
  \item Up to 200 Points for Precision
  \item Up to 200 Points for Speed
  \item Up to 300 Points for Simulation Capabilities
\end{itemize}
